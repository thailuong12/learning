--------------------------------- CLASS ----------------------------------
members: 
	- instance members : accessible from an object.
	- static members : accessible from a class.

--------------------------------- ABSTRACT --------------------------------

abstract class : is a compination of interface and base class, we cannot create an object from an abtrast class directly, cuz its methods 
may just have meaning when a subclass call it.
abstract member : 
	- is just like the member in interfaces, subclass that inherited from this base class will have to have the implementation 
	  of that member by overriding the abstract method. (abstract members can only create in abstract class).
	- you can only override a method of abstract class that decleared as an abstract member, the "virtual" keyword means that you dont 
	  have to override that method but if you want to you can.
